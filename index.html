		<p data-card='{"text": "<h3>Fairness in Assessment</h3><p2>Assessment is an inevitable and crucial part of the teaching practice employed with different intentions, including recognising individual strengths and challenges, keeping track on progress towards proficiency and assigning grades. Understanding what students have learned is vital for devising effective teaching that facilitates genuine learning. The evolution of assessment strategies in higher education that promotes integration of assessment and instruction, underscores a viewpoint which focuses on engaged students, encouraging shared responsibility, reflection, collaboration and ongoing dialogue with the teacher. This new turn calls for moving beyond quantitative grading of merely regurgitated knowledge and pushes towards a deeper understanding of the fundamental role of assessment in the learning process. This includes adopting the methods that reveal individual learning trajectories and how well the learning outcomes have been attained. Assessment is a nuanced and complex activity that needs to take multiple factors in consideration: context, academic level, learning environment, students’ background, individual differences and learning content. Adequate, open and fair assessment can benefit both students as well as teachers. Consequently, assessment literacy is gaining recognition as a core teacher competency.</p2><br><br><p2>As an essential quality of assessment, fairness has been consistently emphasised as an important element of teachers’ assessment literacy. Fairness is seen as a context-dependent multidimensional concept that is influenced by teaching, learning, assessment and classroom interactions, and it is significant to students and teachers alike. In the real-world scenarios, the fairness is habitually interpreted and enacted from two often conflicting perspectives resulting from the difference in fairness perception of the teacher and of the student. Research has shown that fair assessment practices are associated with positive learning outcomes, including cognitive learning and self-efficacy of students.</p2><br><br><p2>Despite the recognised critical importance of fair assessment in teaching, teachers frequently report a lack of sufficient preparation for the task during their education, often predominantly relying on their own experience. To tackle this issue, based on findings from education research, we have developed the Fairness in Assessment Prompt Card Game which can serve as a reflective tool for teachers to evaluate and a prompt to improve their own assessment practices focusing on fairness.</p2><br><br><p2>The inspiration for the game comes from a selection of research papers[1] dealing with topics of fairness and assessment in higher education. A working theoretical scaffold was designed, cross referencing the article frameworks with a focus on fairness in assessment, which yielded a pool of questions as well as three relevant final themes: fairer communication, fairer interaction and fairer approach. A selected set of questions combined with a justice enactment strategy[2] provided a design framework for generating questions which aided in formulating particular teaching situations that were then used as the card content.</p2><br><br><p2>[1] See the reference list[2] Estaji & Zhaleh, 2022</p2>", "category": "D"}'><a href="#" class="sidebar-link">Fairness in Assessment</a></p>
